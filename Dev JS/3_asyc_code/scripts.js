/*
JAVASCRIPT (default)
- JavaScript is synchronous by default (one code at a time)
- single threaded 

Execution Context:
- each operation waits for last one to complete before one


>> BLOCKING Code vs NON-BLOCKING <<
(both are required as per use case)

Blocking: blocks the flow of program
eg: file read sync

Non-BLocking: does not block executiom
eg: read file async
